# Apprenticeship

At datarockets we're happy to work with junior and intern developers when we have available resources. For many of our colleagues, datarockets is the first company in their career.

## Here's what do you need in order to work with us

* You're pro-active and have ideas for projects you want to build.
* You read books and articles about computers, engineering, business, management, economics, and people.
* You have a server you configured on any cloud provider for some reasons.
* You have code of a project to show and may discuss it. We'd love to hear what you think about code and if you may clearly identify issues with it even though you don't know how to solve them.
* You train skills intentionally: you mastered Git, have experience playing with databases, have account in a cloud provider, you solve code puzzles (e.g. on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [exercism](https://exercism.io/) or [Elevator Saga](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/)).
* You visit meetups or workshops on any topics.

## How To Apply

In order to apply send us a message to join@datarockets.com with your CV. In the message, please share the following:

* Your GitHub profile that has repositories with your code or any other source of your code.
* Tell us something you learned just recently and what you think about it (maybe it's something unexpected or something that impressed you for some reasons).
