# UI/UX Designer

Weâ€™re looking for a new teammate who's primary goal will be to turn business problems of our clients into UI/UX-based solutions. In addition to that, we have a plenty of internal design challenges in different areas (own products, marketing, sales) and we need someone who would be ready to pro-actively take over them.

**Salary:** 2k-3k USD gross per month.


## What weâ€™d like from you
- Proactivity. We need someone who communicates proactively and asks questions. We expect that you will be involved in different areas (projects, sales, products) and will take the initiative.
- English. At this role, you will work on client projects and communicate directly. Also, you will be involved into sales process which requires a high level of English to sell design expertise.
- Expertise in UX first and foremost. We will not do large design projects with custom graphics, for example. We're looking for a person who can take a ready-made design system and within it quickly build a UX for a web site or a custom app.
- Independence. We will have the only designer on our team for a while and we can't give them guidance in their career. We need someone who will not burn out on it, but will find interesting ways of development for themselves in our company.
- Interest in AI tools. We see a lot of AI tools that reduce design costs. Given the startup specifics of our customers and the Lean methodology we are trying to launch our products on, we need simplicity and speed. Someone who wouldn't spend days drawing graphics or logos or creating branding, but instead would use tools that would do it for them.


## What do we offer:
- Transparent work culture.
- 50% compensation for self-development activities: courses, conferences, books, educational platforms, English, and sports.
- Remote work and flexible schedule.
- 32 paid days off per year â€“ you can use them for vacations, occasional days off, and public holidays, only workdays count.
- Full coverage of sick leaves.
- 200 USD per year for medical expenses.
- 500 USD per year for home office equipment.
