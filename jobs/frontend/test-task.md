# Description

We use a task from Frontend Mentor and [here is the task](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). You will find the details there but we have some additional requirements:

1. You need to use `React`
1. The app must be deployed (you can find more info in the task's README)
1. The repository must be pushed to GitHub. Use `README-template.md` as a template for your README and fill all information about the project

# What will we be looking at?

- The app architecture
- The app functionality. Everything should work as expected
- Git commits
- Code readability
