## About us

[![datarockets team](https://github.com/datarockets/career/blob/master/images/photo%20from%20New%20Year%20party.3.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/datarockets/)

We are a [Holacracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy)-driven [#remote](https://github.com/datarockets/career#remote) software development company with transparent processes. At datarockets, the medium project duration is 12 months. With most of the clients, we work for years. It means that our main sales goal is not to sign as many contracts as possible (we sign 3-7 new projects a year) but to show our real expertise and build trusting relationships that end up with long-term partnerships.

See [case studies](https://datarockets.com/case-studies/) to learn more about the types of projects we work with. Check out our [#Career page](https://github.com/datarockets/career) to find out how we work, and the [#Company Codex](https://github.com/datarockets/career#work-as-a-team-with-clients) to see if we share the same values  ;)
