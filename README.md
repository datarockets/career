We make products for our clients.

We work remotely.

We have an office in Minsk, Belarus.

We have good processes: we communicate in chats, pair programming over zoom, documentation.

Twice a year we organize a party and bring everyone to it.


### People First

It's ok to make mistakes.

It's ok to have bad days.

Working on a weekend is always a bad option.

### Work as a team with clients

We are in the same chat and everyone can ask questions and voice their opinions. We work with clients that respect this.

Everybody can speak-up and suggest an idea.

Sometimes clients visit us (in different cities) and sometimes we visit them.


## Our Clients

datarockets builds web and mobile applications for startups and businesses. We launch first version of product to confirm that idea is viable and help with existing product development to increase number of users and profit.

We work with clients for years.
