## How We Work

### Remote

ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¾ ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¿ ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡© ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡² ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± ([add yours](#work-with-us))

We work remotely. It's a common comment that it requires a lot of self-discipline to work remotely. We believe it is more about good processes and habits.

Good processes is something we've been working on for the last five years. We moved our conversations to chats. We make calls for pair programming and discussing tasks in real time but always write a summary after the call.

It's important to be pro-active and inform everyone about things you do and obstacles you have even if nobody asks.

We believe that it's much easier to work together when you know your teammates personally, not only their work skills. It is easier to ask someone for help quickly if you were discussing a recent movie premier just yesterday.

In order to make people know each other better we have weekly check-ins â€” an all hands one hour long call where we share what happened with us during the last week: last book we read, a new place we visited, family event we had.

Twice a year we organize a party and bring everyone to it. We spend time together and chat a lot. That's very interesting time since we have people from different cultures. You can learn how traditional wedding parties look like in Vietnam and how to cook lagman.

### People First

![Screenshot on which team lead says it's ok to make mistakes](images/mistakes-are-ok.png)
People make mistakes, nobody is perfect. Nobody gets punished or gets blamed for making a mistake at datarockets. What's important is to learn from mistakes we make.

We understand that "shit happens". Some days we just feel off, procrastinate instead of working, can't get anything done. We promote to take such days off and we never allow to work late hours or on weekend to make up.

Working on a weekend is always a bad option. We never agree when clients ask for overtime work. We offer to use our creativity to find out how we can lauch on time w/o overtime: cut unimportant tasks from scope, do something by hand in the beginning instead of automation, etc.

It is not allowed to work on weekend or overtime at datarockets.

### Work as a team with clients

We care about products we work on, it is unacceptable to just do what you've been told to do when you have concerns and others are not aware of them.

datarockets chooses clients that want to work with us as a single team. We create a Slack workspace per project where everyone, client people and developers chat together. Everyone in the team can ask a question from client directly or initiate a video call meeting at any time.

Client can see how we discuss tasks, how we overcome obstacles, how we make mistakes and learn from them. We don't hide discussions of our mistakes from clients. It creates a lot of trust.

Sometimes clients visit us (in different cities) and sometimes we visit them.

## Our Clients

datarockets builds web and mobile applications for startups and businesses. We launch first version of product to confirm that idea is viable and help with existing product development to increase number of users and profit.

We work with clients for years.

## Interview Process

- We have 3-steps interview process. During the process we discuss different things: education, courses, books, articles, and blogs; application architecture, libraries, frameworks, and code snippets; we touch teams, colleagues, and clients. Basically, we are curious about your interests and way of thinking. And we are happy to share ours.

- We're not looking for correct answers or for a candidate to agree with our views on particular topics. Sometimes the best answer is "I don't know". We love responses like "I don't know but I think ...". We're looking for a great conversation, the one we might have on a conference afterparty.

- Also, we love questions. Don't forget to bring them to the conversation as well.

- We chat in English.

- Please maintain the same subject during the conversation and don't exclude participants (use reply-all).

- If you understand that we don't match feel free to stop and provide your feedback at any time to save your and our time. We would do the same from our side.

- We record the interviews in order to have the opportunity to improve the process and come back to the topics we discussed. We can send the recording after the interview to the candidate by request. We do not record interviews if the candidate asked us not to do it.  

### 1. Conversation with HR

We chat on email or other social/professional network and then we chat on video-interview. We ask questions about previous projects, current stage of your development, interests, preferencies. We share more about us and answer you first questions.

### 2. Video-chats with datarockers (Technical part)

Every datarocker has its own style and own plan for interviewing people. At this step candidates may expect to do some pair-programming and real world project problem solving.

### 2. Video-chat with CTO (Overall part)

Expect to have deep conversations about technologies and development experience. There are usually a problem-solving discusions, related to technologies and people.
